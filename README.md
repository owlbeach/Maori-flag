Maori-flag made in p5js
The official red colour for the MƒÅori flag is (227, 24, 55)

However, (212, 0, 0) is a darker red which may look better depending on the type of device you're displaying the image on.

I couldn't find any proportions for the flag online so the flag is not pixel perfect

You can comment out noStroke(); to show the outlines for the flag which shows how it was made
